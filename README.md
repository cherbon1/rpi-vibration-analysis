# rpi-vibration-analysis

RaspberryPi powered automatic vibration monitoring station.

To-do:
- Troubleshoot/fix/test writing to influxDB.

## Vibration monitoring station: Instructions

[comment]: <> (The vibration station consists of:)
[comment]: <> (- A Wilcoxon acclerometer and amplifier)
[comment]: <> (- A Raspberry Pi with a DAQ hat and a relay switch HAT)
[comment]: <> (- A battery charger and 2 9-volt batteries)
[comment]: <> (- Custom controls)

### Configuration files and output files
The vibration station loads its measurement parameters from config files stored on Cerberous, a network file storage system hosted in our lab. The recorded data is saved to Cerberous as well. Therefore, if you want to use the built-in DAQ to measure data, **it is imperative that the vibration station has a conenction to the network.**

#### Connecting to Cerberous
In your file explorer of choice, connect to `cerberous.ee.ethz.ch`. The vibration data is stored in the subfolder `BuildingVibration`. By default, members of our group have read-only access to this folder. If you need write access, e.g. to modify a config file, you should connect with the `vibrationLogger` credentials. The corresponding password can be found in our group OneNote. (This repository is public, I don't want to share the password here)

#### File structure of Cerberous
The `BuildingVibration` folder contains 4 main subfolders:
- `config` contains the configuration files for the measurement parameters
- `d` and `m` contain the automated measurement data done by the D-floor station and M-floor station respectively
- `custom` contains manual measurement data

### Configuration of measurements
If you want to modify the configuration of a measurement, connect to Cerberous and edit the corresponding file in the `config` folder (auto/manual measurements, d/m floor station).

The fields to be edited should be self-explanatory. If you want to restore a file to its default state, simply copy the corresponding config file in this repository.

Once again, **the station must be connected to the network** or else it won't be able to read the config files from or save data to Cerberous

### Automated measurements of building vibrations at regular intervals
1.	Connect the station to power and to the network
2.	Verify that the accelerometer settings are correct: On, `450Hz`, `1000V/g`
3.	Set the control switch to `Auto` (top position). One LED should be on at all times. If either both or neither are on, something's wrong.

### Manual measurements using the built-in DAQ
1.	Connect the station to power and to the network
2.	Verify that the accelerometer settings are correct: On, `450Hz`, `1000V/g`
3.	Set the control switch to `Manual`. One LED should be on at all times. If either both or neither are on, something's wrong
4.	Press the Record button to launch a measurement using the settings found in `config_manual.json` (See section [Configuration of Measurements](#Configuration-of-measurements) on how to edit settings)
5.	When youâ€™re done, turn off the accelerometer (switch to off) and shutdown the station (see below)
6.	Your measurements can be found on Cerberous, in the folder `/BuildingVibrations/custom`, with the filename specified in `config_manual.json`

### Manual measurements using an external DAQ
1.	Shutdown the station (see below)
2.	Disconnect the station from power and network
3.	Choose your accelerometer settings on the front panel
4.	Use the BNC output at the back of the station to connect your DAQ

### Charging the batteries
If the batteries ever get completely discharged, you may want to recharge them without ever measuring. When the station
is in the `Ready` state, press and hold the record button for 2 seconds to put the station into a charging state.
Both LEDs should turn on. In this state, the batteries are constantly connected to the charger. To exit this state, 
simply flip the manual/auto switch to go back to the corresponding mode.  
Note that under normal operation, this charging mode shouldn't be necessary.

### Shutting down the station
When the station is in the `Ready` state, press and hold the record button for 2 seconds to put the station into
its charging state. Press and hold the button for 2 seconds again to shut down the station.
Alternatively, connect to the station via SSH, and shut down with 
sudo shutdown now

### Other things you may want to do:
#### Connect to station remotely
Connect to the station via SSH (e.g. `ssh pi@raspberry-pi-02.ee.ethz.ch` in a terminal) or via VNC Viewer
(free app from RealVNC). 
The log-in details are listed on the group OneNote.

#### Verify the status of the python program
1.	Connect to station remotely
2.	In a terminal, type in the command: `service vibration-logging status`

#### Verify the logs
1.	Connect to station remotely
2.	In a terminal, type in the command: `tail -f ./Documents/vibration-logger.log`

#### Use different config files
1.	Connect to station remotely
2.	Edit the config file names (`config_file_auto` or `config_file_manual`) in `/home/pi/Documents/rpi-vibration-analysis/main.py`

Requires: [daqhats](https://github.com/mccdaq/daqhats),
[influxdb-client-python](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python), and the usual
suspects (`numpy`, `h5py`, `scipy`, `pandas`)
